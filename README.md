## Information
This is a tool that helps non-Japanese speakers complete the 
`Great Battle! Shiritori Dragons` minigame that was introduced with the 
`Dragon Explorers` event.

Although this tool can be used just to easily clear the minigame, it 
also helps you figure out the words you need to complete the word catalog.

Completing the word catalog (100%) grants the following title as a reward:<br>

As of `April 30, 2021`, the word catalog was updated to include `248` new words.<br>
To unlock this new word catalog, you must do the following:
  - Read the event story for `Inori SOS!! Time Traveling Dragons` (`イノリＳＯＳ！！　タイムトラベル・ドラゴンズ`)
  - Play one game.

Completing this new catalog (100%) will grant the following title as a reward:<br>

## How to Use
1. Open the tool URL in a web browser (<https://paulzzh.github.io/priconne-shiritori-cn/>)
2. If you have existing progress already...

    1. Click `Open Word List`
    2. Click the "phrase buttons" for the phrases you already have
    3. Confirm that your phrase count matches the amount on the top of the page
    4. Click `Close Word List` if everything looks correct
      
3. Start the `Great Battle! Shiritori Dragons` minigame
4. Look at the card **Kaya** chooses, pause the minigame and select that card.
5. A list of possible options will be displayed on the tool. Find a phrase 
that you need or that is good enough to continue if you can not locate any phrases you need.
6. Eventually, you may enter a `Rush` state. If you can manage to select multiple cards during this time, 
turn on `Rush Mode` by clicking the button that only appears on **Kaya**'s turn.
7. Repeat until the minigame ends. When the game is over, reset the board by clicking the `Reset Game` button.
